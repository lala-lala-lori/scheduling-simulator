# Operating system + Object oriented programming combined **assignment**

Topic:
	Create Scheduling algorithm simulator
     
    Implemented Algorithms - 
	1. First come first serve
	2. Shortest remaining time first
	3. Round Robin
	
Input: Scheduling Algorithm, Simulation time, Burst time limit, Number of processes.
( Using random number genrator for arrival time and cpu burst time of process )
Ouput: Completion time, Response time, Remaining time(if not process completed),Turn  around time, Waiting time
( Table will also be created into a file - {using dup2 for redirect stdout into file} )


Sample Output: 

		pid arv  brt  c_t tAt w_t rsp_t r_bt : Table Column Order

		[  2    0   11   11  11   0   0   0 ]
		[  3   11    6   18   7   1   1   0 ]
